# soul-exorcist
 "Soul Exorcist" is a collaborative project undertaken by a group of five friends with diverse skills. The team comprises a designer, a project manager, a programmer, an artist, and a quality assurance tester. The goal of the project is to develop a game using the Pygame framework inspired by the mechanics of "Soul Knight" but with a unique twist. The game revolves around an amateur exorcist delving into haunted realms to banish evil spirits and restore peace.
